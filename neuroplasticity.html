        <h2>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</dt>
             <dd class="paragraph">Understanding nueroplasticity is understanding that your brain is capable of adapting, also meaning it can also continue to change throughout ones life. This is done through strengthening already existing neural pathways or creating stronger and better new ones.</dd>
             <dd class="paragraph">This benefits people as the outdated idea that your brain is limited and has a predetermined level of intelligence is disrupted. This collapses the barriers that stand in the way of learning, encouraging all people, importantly students, to engage with learning, feeling empowered by knowing they are capable.</dd>
            <dt>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity and how might you engage with these principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</dt>
             <dd class="paragraph"> For me to strengthen my neural pathways I will keep practicing. Repeating what I’ve learned will allow these pathways to be used over and over again, and therefore strengthened. This also includes reflecting on what I’ve learned. When you reflect you are engage with what you’ve learned introspectively and intuitively, as well as putting the information in to context.</dd>
             <dd class="paragraph"> From researching neuroplasticity, mnemonic drills are another way of strengthening your neural pathways. As I looked into it further, I realised this is definitely something I have engaged with in the past and will continue to do so.</dd>
            <dd class="paragraph"> All these ways will benefit me as I engage with content I learn throughout dev, practicing the principles of neuroplasticity will help me learn this not only assiduously, but also long term.</dd>

        <h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>  
          <dl>
            <dt>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph"> Growth mindset is the belief that one can learn anything through dedication and hard work.</dd>
              <dd class="paragraph">It is not simply the idea that through hard work you can learn anything, but rather it counteracts the idea that if you can’t do or learn something, you will never be able to. This ties in with neuroplasticity as the idea that the brain is malleable and adaptable. </dd>
             <dd class="paragraph">There is an abundance of evidence (taking place in schools) that suggests if a student believes their brain can grow they behave differently being more motivated which leads to achievement. This is relevant to me as I am currently a student. Being an intensive bootcamp where I will learn a lot of content in a short period of time, the attributes of a growth mindset; motivation, effort, confidence, will help me not get through the next couple of months.</dd>
            <dt>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph"> I am excited to see the implications of a growth mindset on my confidence. I have unintentionally adopted a fixed mindset throughout my schooling life and I can see the negative impacts its hard on my learning.</dd>
            <dt>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</dt>
             <dd class="paragraph"> I think the first step for me is being aware when I am practicing a fixed mindset. If I find myself telling myself “I can’t,” then I know to remind myself of the principles of growth mindset. The biggest being embracing challenges as opportunities to learn. </dd>
