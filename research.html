          What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          A web page is made up of many boxes despite whether they look like boxes or not.<br>Each box consists of the margin, padding and border.<br>These three elements are surrounding the content, whether that be text, and image or a title.
          <br><u>follow along with the images!</u><br>
          Here we have the content... lets take a look at whats beneath the surface

        </p>
        <dl>
          <img id="mbpimg" src="images/1.jpg" alt="image of content"><br>
          <dt>PADDING</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">the padding is the negative space (empty) immediately beyond the content of this particular box.</dd>
          <img id="mbpimg" src="images/2.jpg" alt="image of content"><br>
          <dt>BORDER</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">The border is the line that separates the margin and the padding. The border doesn’t need to be visible</dd>
          <img id="mbpimg" src="images/3.jpg" alt="image of content"><br>
          <dt>MARGIN</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">The margin is the negative space beyond the border</dd>       
          <img id="mbpimg" src="images/4.jpg" alt="image of content"><br>
        </dl>
        <p class="paragraph">
          ANALOGY<br>
          An analogy for the margin border and padding is similar to a bed in a bedroom
          If the person was the content, the padding would be the mattress (think like the mattress is soft and padded =padding!)
          The border would be the bed frame
          And the margin would be the room the bed is in.
          In CSS you change the sized of these three elements… Is is a child in a single bed in a huge bedroom? Or is it a basketball player in a king bed in a small room?
