                My name is Alex, I am 23 years old and live in Auckland where I was born and raised.
                <br><br>
                I have just graduated with a bachelors of fine arts where I navigated around ideas of critical thinking and creative problem solving, as well as my own art practice.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="paragraph">
                I love games, board games, card games, video games… I’d probably play musical chairs eagerly if someone set it up. I will play anyone in backgammon but I hate chess. I love getting tattoos and have an on-again-off-again relationship with crocheting.

                My personal values:
                - Expressing myself, my thoughts and feelings. This helps me process thoughts and processes externally. I do this through conversation, art, writing and collecting. 
                - Humour is the best way I express myself and connect with others. Laughing with people is the best way to connect and feel bonded 
                According to friends: - Friendship and Empathy “you make a considered effort to make sure people remain in your life. And the empathy goes both ways like you’re a shoulder and your friends can do this for you — condition of a friend is this shared empathy” -->
