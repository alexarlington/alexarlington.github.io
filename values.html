        <h2>Values:</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Expressing myself</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">my thoughts and feelings. This helps me process thoughts and processes externally. I do this through conversation, art, writing and collecting. </dd>
          <dt>Humour</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">Humour is the best way I express myself and connect with others. Laughing with people is the best way to connect and feel bonded</dd>
          <dt>Friendship and Empathy</dt>
          <dd class="paragraph">According to friends:<i> “you make a considered effort to make sure people remain in your life. And the empathy goes both ways like you’re a shoulder and your friends can do this for you — condition of a friend is this shared empathy”</i></dd>     
        </dl>
        <h2>Strengths and Limitations:</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
          One biggest strength is that I am a hard worker. I give a job 100% of my effort and really get stuck into tasks or jobs. Unfortunately there is a down side that is I won’t do as well if I don’t enjoy it. This is why I am doing dev as I do enjoy it and want a career that I enjoy doing. 
         </p>
         <p class="paragraph"> My biggest limitation is my self-criticism. I have always been overly self critical and it has never gotten me anywhere. It is only when I let go of my too-high expectations that I do well and enjoy myself in the process.
