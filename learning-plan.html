          My long term goal would be to pursue a career that intersects with web development and creativity. I have struggled with finding work that is worthwhile and meaningful for me. I have wanted to web development for a long time but found learning the content to be unaccessible to do from home and intimidating to do in an institution.

          My skills outside of technical are pretty ripe! I have learned a lot of people skills with years in hospitality and a lot of empathy with simply navigating the world around me. The biggest one I would be curious to see would be my team-work skills as I haven’t had so much experience with team projects!

          To manage my workload in this program will be a big obstacle and I’m sure I am not the first to anticipate this. When managing a big workload for me is to take one step at a time. When looking at everything you need to do it can be overwhelming and bog you down with the thought of everything you need to do. With doing one thing at a time is to make sure I am not being distracted with unimportant tasks and to not multitask in an unproductive way.

          When things start to build up, which they have many times before, I know the best thing for me would be to either communicate with a facilitator or if I get too overwhelmed, I will remove myself from the situation temporarily. This has worked countless times in the past for me. I am not cautious to ask for help, it is a skill I learned a long time ago.<br>What I expect from the facilitation team is compassion for when things get overwhelming and patience when helping me through a problem. In return I will be kind and grateful and continue to work hard.
