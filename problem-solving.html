        <h2>The problem and Solution:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph"> I ran into a lot of problems doing the kata’s as I felt ill prepared in my javascript knowledge in comparison to what was being asked.</p>   
          <p class="paragraph"> I asked my peers, mostly at the start to help me get over a few hurdles. Towards the end I managed to figure out what was being asked and was able to simply google it from there.</p>   
        <h2>Reflection:</h2>
          <p class="paragraph">I felt extremely overwhelmed and terrible. There was a huge gap between starting and finishing as my anxiety started to escalate. Sometimes when something is making you anxious, the thing that is causing this manifests into a much bigger problem - eventually becoming a trigger. It also hinders your normal brain function where communication becomes really difficult and ones problem solving ability becomes drowned out by the cycle of anxious thinking.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">I learned a couple of interesting things. The first being when I am in a state of anxiety one thing I need is to be listened too. I didn’t realise how much I needed this until it happened. I found myself calm down after feeling as though <i>a)</i> my worries were being heard and <i>b)</i> they were being addressed.<br>The second thing I am completely capable. After I had calmed down I was able to do it significantly better than before which really highlighted how debilitating my mindset made me.</p>

          <h2>Techniques and Processes:</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>Pseudocode</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph"> I tried pseudocode and it wasn’t particularly helpful when I did it but I can see in the future how it would be </dd>            </dl>
            <dt>Trying something</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph"> sometimes I would write the code in my own way and then somehow translate it to actual JS code which I enjoyed. Usually the logic is correct.</dd>
            <dt>Rubber ducky method</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph">I unintentionally used this a couple times! I turned to someone to ask for help and immediately saw the problem before they got a word in.</dd>
            <dt>Reading error messages</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph">Definitely something I need to get better at but have started doing</dd>
            <dt>Console.logging</dt>
              <dd class="paragraph">Need to do this more - sometimes I find it difficult to do if that makes sense? Like when do you do it?</dd>
            <dt>Googling</dt>
